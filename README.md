### Installation Instructions ###

**Prerequisites**

- Install Maven v3.5 or higher from [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp%3A%2F%2Fmirror.reverse.net%2Fpub%2Fapache%2F) 
- Set/update environment variables M2_HOME and MAVEN_HOME pointing to your Maven folder
- Append Maven bin folder to PATH environment variable
- In command prompt, check version with following command:
`mvn --version`
- Install Java JDK 8 from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- Make sure that the environment variable JAVA\_HOME is pointing to the JDK and not the JRE folder. JAVA\_HOME should be pointing for example to *C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_02*. Instructions to set JAVA\_HOME depending of your OS are [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t)
- If you choose to run the OSLC API on a different port than *8080*, change the port in [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties) and in [pom.xml](pom.xml) in `<server.port>8080</server.port>`
- If you choose to run the OSLC API on a different domain than *localhost*, change the domain in [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties) 

**Configuration to enable OAuth (optional)**

- Skip this section if you want to launch the OSLC API without OAuth authentication
- **Choose to enable OAuth authentication (e.g. isOauthEnabled = true)** in [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties) 
- OSLC Jama API uses its own consumerstore. You can use an existing one by downloading on your machine [jamaOAuthStore.xml](jamaOAuthStore.xml). This consumerstore already contains a consumer named *magicdraw* having *testkey* as key and *testsecret* as secret. The secret is encrypted in *jamaOAuthStore.xml*. 
- If you prefer to create a new consumerstore with different consumer credentials, you can modify and run [ConsumerStoreCreator.java](src\main\java\com\jama\oslc\web\ConsumerStoreCreator.java) 
- **Specify the location of the file-based consumerstore as URI** (e.g. *localConsumerStoreLocation = file:/C:/Users/.../git/oslc-adapter-jama2/jamaOAuthStore.xml*) in [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties)
-  By default, the consumerstore used by the OSLC API is located at A Java application can be used to add/remove consumers to the OSLC Jama API consumerstore. 
-  Keep in mind that the OSLC Jama API uses the credentials of a regular Jama user account to communicate with the Jama REST API. 
- Download the Wildfly server, for example from [http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/10.1.0.Final/wildfly-10.1.0.Final.zip](http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/10.1.0.Final/wildfly-10.1.0.Final.zip). It will be necessary to host the OSLC Jama API on a standalone Wildfly server, instead of a Wildfly server launched by Maven, in order to avoid this [error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25644007/request-io-undertow-servlet-spec-httpservletrequestimpl-was-not-original-or-a-wr). 
- Unzip the zip file containing Wildfly. 
- In the standalone/configuration/standalone.xml file change the servlet-container XML element so that it has the attribute *allow-non-standard-wrappers="true"*.
 

**Running the Jama OSLC API**

- Download this zip file [koneksys-oslc-adapter-jama.zip](https://github.com/OSLC/oslc-adapter-jama/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip it
- Open a terminal (command window) and navigate to the root folder containing the *pom.xml* file of the unzipped file 
- **Set your your Jama subdomain, username and password** in [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties). Keep in mind that the OSLC Jama API uses the credentials of a regular Jama user account to communicate with the Jama REST API. 
- **Choose to enable or disable OAuth authentication** (e.g. isOauthEnabled = false) in [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties) 
- **If OAuth is disabled**, run the OSLC API by opening a command prompt, change your directory to the root directory of the Jama OSLC API, the one containing the pom.xml file, and then run this command `mvn clean install wildfly:run`
- **If OAuth is enabled**, first make sure that you have set up a management user account for Wildfly. You can create one by running the *adduser* script (e.g. by running the *{Wildfly root}/bin/add-user* batch file on Windows), launch the standalone Wildfly server (e.g. by running the *{Wildfly root}/bin/standalone* batch file on Windows), compile the Maven project of the Jama OSLC API  using a command prompt as described in the step before if OAuth is disabled but with this command `mvn clean install`, verify that the war file has been created at *target\jama-oslc-adapter.war*, open in your browser this page [http://localhost:9990/console/App.html#standalone-deployments](http://localhost:9990/console/App.html#standalone-deployments) by signing in with your Wildfly management user account, click the *Add* button and select the *target\jama-oslc-adapter.war* file. Wildly will then host the Jama OSLC API
- Perform `CTRL+C` to stop the OSLC API

### Getting Started ###

Explore OSLC Jama resources by viewing them in HTML in your browser. Navigate through OSLC resources as described in the [OSLC Core Specification](https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification) 

![](https://archive.open-services.net/pub/Main/OSLCCoreSpecDRAFT/oslc-core-overview.png)


**If OAuth is enabled**, access the rootservices resource at [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/rootservices](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/rootservices). If using your browser, you will download a file named *rootservices.rdf*. This document will show the *ServiceProviderCatalog URL*, *oauthRequestTokenUrl*, *oauthUserAuthorizationUrl*, and *oauthAccessTokenUrl*, as shown below. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <ns1:Description xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:ns2="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:ns8="http://open-services.net/xmlns/cm/1.0/" xmlns:ns9="http://jazz.net/xmlns/prod/jazz/jfs/1.0/" xmlns:ns10="http://jazz.net/ns/ui#" xmlns:ns11="http://jazz.net/xmlns/prod/jazz/calm/1.0/" xmlns:ns12="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" ns1:about="http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services//rootservices">
    <ns2:title>OSLC Adapter/Jira Root Services</ns2:title>
    <ns8:cmServiceProviders ns1:resource="http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services//catalog/singleton"/>
    <ns9:oauthRequestTokenUrl ns1:resource="http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services//oauth/requestToken"/>
    <ns9:oauthUserAuthorizationUrl ns1:resource="http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services//oauth/authorize"/>
    <ns9:oauthAccessTokenUrl ns1:resource="http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services//oauth/accessToken"/>
    <ns9:oauthRealmName>Jama</ns9:oauthRealmName>
    <ns9:oauthRequestConsumerKeyUrl ns1:resource="http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services//oauth/requestKey"/>
    </ns1:Description>

Specify in [OAuthClient.java](src\main\java\com\jama\oslc\client\OAuthClient.java) your consumer name, key and secret, as well as oauthRequestTokenUrl, oauthUserAuthorizationUrl, and oauthAccessTokenUrl. Run  [OAuthClient.java](src\main\java\com\jama\oslc\client\OAuthClient.java) to get a requesttoken. The OAuthClient will then print in the console the following message:

    > log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.http.impl.conn.tsccm.ThreadSafeClientConnManager).
    > log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
    > log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.
    > Enter this URL in a browser and run again: http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=bfca9c38-78b3-4848-bfb7-694401e5cc96
    > org.eclipse.lyo.client.oslc.OAuthRedirectException
    > 	at org.eclipse.lyo.client.oslc.OslcOAuthClient.getResourceInternal(OslcOAuthClient.java:203)
    > 	at org.eclipse.lyo.client.oslc.OslcOAuthClient.getResource(OslcOAuthClient.java:113)
    > 	at com.jama.oslc.client.OAuthClient.main(OAuthClient.java:28)

Follow the instruction printed in the console: 
> Enter this URL in a browser and run again: http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=bfca9c38-78b3-4848-bfb7-694401e5cc96
> 

Your url to authorize your token  will be different so please use the url as printed in your console and do not copy the url in this readme. 

After entering the authorization url in a browser, you will see a login screen where you will be asked to provide your Jama user account credentials to authorize a third-party application to access your OSLC Jama API data on your behalf. 

You can reuse the Jama user account credentials defined in [config.properties](src/main/resources/config.properties). If your credentials are valid, you should see this message in the browser: *Request authorized*. Then you can access all resources of the OSLC Jama API as if OAuth was disabled. 

Start with the **Service Provider Catalog** resource (entry point resource) at [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProviderCatalog](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProviderCatalog). It will show you the Jama projects exposed by the OSLC API. The ServiceProviderCatalog has links to ServiceProvider resources, one for each Jama project containing an item of type Stakeholder requirement (item type id = 45).

Click on a **ServiceProvider resource** (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProvider/Semiconductor_Sample_Set](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProvider/Semiconductor_Sample_Set)). It describes a Jama project. A ServiceProvider resource has links to **Service** resources. In the case of the Jama OSLC API, a Service resource has links to a **CreationFactory** and a **QueryCapability** resource. As the ServiceProvider resource contains the inline representation of the Service, CreationFRactory and QueryCapability resources, the HTML representation of the ServiceProvider directly resource displays  the details of the CreationFaactory and QueryCapability resources. The inline representation of linked resources in the ServiceProvider resource is visible when viewing the RDF representation of the ServiceProvider resource. 

Click on a **Jama Requirements Query Capability** (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement)). It will display all requirements contained in a a Jama project. Note: it will only display requirements of type "Stakeholder Requirement". Additional requirements types can be exposed by the OSLC API through additional item type-specific query capabilities or through a single query capability exposing all requirements as items with different types. The **Jama Requirements Creation Factory** resource is primarily used by applications using the OSLC API as a client. The Creation Factory resource therefore does not require an HTML representation. As a reminder, all HTML representations of resources provided by the OSLC API are optional. Only the RDF representation of resources exposed by the OSLC API is mandatory.  

Click on an individual Jama Requirement **resource** (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement/3919](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement/3919)). It will display the main attributes of a Jama requirement. 

Access this [web page](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/uipreview) hosted by the OSLC API to test the OSLC UI Preview. Hover over the link to a Jama requirement to see a UI preview window pop up. The UI Preview window can contain custom information and be formatted in various ways. The window size (height, width, and small vs large preview) information is defined according to the OSLC standard.

### Setting the OAuth cookie in Postman ###

In order to access RDF resources from this API with OAuth enabled, you need to send your OAuth cookie together with the request. This cookie is printed after authenticating your username and password.

<img height="70" src="images/oauth-cookie.PNG" />

In postman, click on the cookie link as shown below.

<img height="100" src="images/cookie-edit.PNG" />

Now find the domain in which the Jama API is running and click on the JSESSIONID cookie. If the domain has various JSESSIONID cookies, find the one that shows `path=/jama-oslc-adapter`

<img height="200" src="images/cookie-value.PNG" />

After finding the right cookie, please copy the JSESSIONID value shown in the authentication page and replace it in postman.

After saving the cookie, you should be able to access the RDF resources normally.

### Testing the OSLC API manually using curl or a REST client ###

- Install curl (Instructions for Windows can be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/13_2/messagingservice/files/installing_curl_command_line_tool_on_windows.html))
- Run following curl commands in the command window, or equivalent commands in your REST client (e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)), to get the RDF representation of resources exposed by the OSLC API
- If OAuth is enabled, please add your OAuth cookie as a parameter to the curl request
